## Session Context
On new session, run `pactkit update --if-needed` to sync project files if PactKit was upgraded.
If `pactkit.yaml` does not exist (check `{PROJECT_CONFIG_DIR}/`), run `pactkit init` to create it before proceeding.
Then read `docs/product/context.md` to understand project state before taking action.
If the file is missing, suggest `/project-init` to bootstrap the project.
If "Last updated" date is before today, suggest running `$daily-retro`.

## Visual First
Before modifying code:
- Run `visualize` to view module dependency graph
- Run `visualize --mode class` for class inheritance
- Run `visualize --mode call --entry <func>` to trace call chains
- **PDCA Exemption**: When a PDCA command is active, the command's own visualize phases take precedence — skip Visual First.

## Strict TDD
- Write tests first (RED), then write implementation (GREEN)
- The agent MUST NOT skip TDD except when running `/project-hotfix`
- All tests must pass before committing

## Language Matching
- Match the user's language (Chinese→Chinese, English→English).
- Technical terms (function names, file paths, git commands) stay in original form.

## Subagent Model Selection
Select `model` based on task complexity:

| Model | When to Use |
|-------|-------------|
| **haiku** | File search, format checks, info extraction |
| **sonnet** | Code implementation, test writing, general tasks (default) |
| **opus** | Architecture decisions, deep reasoning, multi-step planning |

**Cost**: haiku ~10x cheaper than sonnet, sonnet ~5x cheaper than opus.
""",
    "hierarchy": """# The Hierarchy of Truth
> **CRITICAL**: Code is NOT the law.
1.  **Tier 1**: **Specs** (`docs/specs/*.md`) & **Test Cases** (`docs/test_cases/*.md`).
2.  **Tier 2**: **Tests** (The verification of the law).
3.  **Tier 3**: **Implementation** (The mutable reality).

## Conflict Resolution Rules
- When Spec conflicts with code: **Spec takes precedence**, modify the code
- When Spec conflicts with tests: **Spec takes precedence**, modify the tests
- When the Spec itself is found to be incorrect: fix the Spec first, then sync code and tests

## RFC Protocol (Spec Amendment Escalation)
- If the Senior Developer determines a Spec requirement is technically infeasible, contradictory, or would violate security/architectural constraints, they MUST invoke the RFC Protocol rather than producing non-compliant code
- RFC Protocol: STOP implementation, report the infeasibility to the user, suggest alternatives, and wait for guidance
- This exception does NOT weaken the general principle (Spec > Code) — it adds a safety valve for genuinely impossible requirements

## Pre-existing Test Protocol
- If a pre-existing test fails during regression, **do not modify** the failing test or the code it tests
- STOP and report: which test failed, what it tests, which change caused it
- You MUST NOT assume you understand the design intent behind pre-existing tests

## Operating Guidelines
- Before modifying code, you must first read the relevant Spec (`docs/specs/`)
- Before modifying tests, you must first read the corresponding Test Case (`docs/test_cases/`)
- When unsure whether a Spec exists, use `Glob` to search `docs/specs/*.md` (covers STORY-*, HOTFIX-*, BUG-* prefixes)
- **Exemption**: `/project-plan` and `/project-design` create new Specs — they are exempt from "read Spec before modifying code" since the Spec does not yet exist.

If source files changed (per `LANG_PROFILES[stack].source_dirs`) OR `code_graph.mmd` is missing, run visualize in all 3 modes (file, class, call). Else skip with log: "Graph up-to-date — no source changes".

## Test Mapping Protocol

""",
    "architecture": """# Architecture Principles

> Derived from SOLID, DRY, 12-Factor App, and Defense-in-Depth practices.
> Violations of MUST rules are treated as bugs. SHOULD rules are advisory.

## 1. Single Source of Truth (DRY)
- Every configuration value, schema definition, or structural rule MUST be defined in exactly one place.
- Canonical locations:
  - Environment paths/capabilities → `profiles.py` (`FormatProfile`)
  - Document structure rules → `schemas.py` (`SPEC_REQUIRED_SECTIONS`, `BOARD_SECTIONS`, `CONTEXT_SECTIONS`, etc.)
  - Valid component sets → `config.py` (`VALID_AGENTS`, `VALID_COMMANDS`, `VALID_SKILLS`, `VALID_RULES`)
- When standalone scripts (board.py, scaffold.py) cannot import the library, they MUST inline the value with a comment pointing to the canonical source:
  ```python
  # Canonical: src/pactkit/schemas.py BOARD_SECTION_BACKLOG
  _BACKLOG = '## 📋 Backlog'
  ```
- When updating a canonical value, search all inline copies with `grep` and update them in the same commit.

## 2. Open-Closed Principle (OCP)
- Adding a new tool format (e.g., `cursor`, `trae`) MUST NOT require modifying existing functions.
- Pattern: add a new `FormatProfile` entry to `FORMAT_PROFILES` in `profiles.py`. All downstream code (`deployer`, `config`, `CLI`) auto-picks it up.
- Adding a new document type MUST only require adding constants to `schemas.py` and an entry to `SCHEMA_REGISTRY`.

## 3. Dependency Inversion (DIP)
- Prompt templates MUST NOT contain hardcoded environment-specific paths.
- Pattern: use named placeholders (`{SKILLS_ROOT}`, `{BOARD_CMD}`, `{PACTKIT_YAML}`) resolved at deploy time by `_render_prompt(template, profile)`.
- Functions MUST accept a `profile: FormatProfile` parameter instead of format-specific booleans (`opencode_format=True`) or manual path strings (`skills_prefix="~/.config/opencode/skills"`).

## 4. Liskov Substitution (LSP) — Deploy Chain Parity
- All deployer classes (ClassicDeployer, OpenCodeDeployer, etc.) MUST support the same user-facing feature set:
  - Selective deployment (read `pactkit.yaml`)
  - Auto-merge on upgrade (`auto_merge_config_file`)
  - Legacy cleanup (`_cleanup_legacy`)
  - Project-level instructions file generation
- Format-specific features (e.g., hooks for Claude Code, opencode.json for OpenCode) are extensions, not omissions.

## 5. Interface Segregation (ISP)
- Each `FormatProfile` exposes only the fields relevant to that format:
  - `commands_dir = None` for formats without custom commands
  - `excluded_agent_fields` removes fields invalid for that format
- Consumers MUST check `if profile.has_custom_commands` before deploying commands — not hardcoded format checks.

## 6. Defense-in-Depth (Security)
- **Path traversal**: All file writes use `atomic_write()` which creates parent directories safely.
- **Config isolation**: `_generate_config_if_missing(format=)` writes to the format-specific directory only. Never cross-write.
- **No secret leakage**: `_render_prompt()` variables are all path-based, never credential-based.
- **Standalone script safety**: Skill scripts (board.py, scaffold.py) MUST NOT execute arbitrary imports. Use `try/except ImportError` fallback for pactkit imports.

## 7. Template Rendering Safety
- Use sequential `str.replace()` in `_render_prompt()` — NOT `str.format_map()` or f-strings.
  - Reason: prompt templates contain user-facing complex keys like `{R1, R2, ...}`, `{score}`, `{NNN}` that cause `ValueError: Empty attribute` in Python's format parser.
- JSON literals in templates (`{"key": "value"}`) are naturally safe with sequential replacement — no escaping needed.
- When converting f-string prompt constants to template strings, add legacy variables (e.g., `{M}` for backticks) to the `_render_prompt` var_map.

## 8. Schema Consistency Gate
- Every document type with a structure schema in `schemas.py` SHOULD have a corresponding linter/validator.
- Currently enforced:
  - Spec → `spec_linter.py` (E001-E008, W001-W005) — **blocks /project-act**
  - Board → `board.py` regex parsing — **runtime enforcement**
- Currently advisory only:
  - context.md, lessons.md, test_case → referenced in playbook text via `{CONTEXT_SECTIONS}`, `{LESSONS_ROW_FORMAT}`
- When adding a new schema to `schemas.py`, consider whether it needs a linter gate or if prompt-level enforcement is sufficient.

## Quick Reference: Where to Make Changes

| Change Type | File to Edit | Auto-Propagation |
|-------------|-------------|------------------|
| New tool format | `profiles.py` → `FORMAT_PROFILES` | CLI, deployer, config, VALID_FORMATS |
| New document type | `schemas.py` → `SCHEMA_REGISTRY` | `pactkit schema`, playbooks via render_prompt |
| New template variable | `deployer.py` → `_render_prompt()` var_map | All deployed prompts |
| New spec rule | `schemas.py` + `spec_linter.py` | scaffold, playbooks |
| New prompt placeholder | `profiles.py` (if env-specific) or `schemas.py` (if doc-specific) | `_render_prompt()` |
""",
    "sectional": """# Sectional Write Protocol

## Rule
When generating **any file** (code, document, test, HTML, etc.) that will exceed **300 lines**:

1. **Write skeleton first**: Create the file with the structural framework (imports, class/function signatures, section headings) via a single Write call
2. **Edit block-by-block**: Fill in one logical block at a time, using Edit after each block before starting the next
3. **Checkpoint between blocks**: After each Edit, print a brief progress message (e.g., "Block 2/5 written.")
4. **Never accumulate**: Do NOT compose the entire file in reasoning before writing — write as you go

## Applies To — any file type over 300 lines
- Documents: PRD, specs, README, architecture guides
- Source code: large modules, multi-endpoint API files, data models
- Tests: test files with many test classes or scenarios
- HTML/templates: prototypes, page templates

## Does NOT Apply To
- Short files (< 300 lines): single Write is fine
- Small config files (YAML, JSON, TOML)

## Anti-Pattern (DO NOT)
```
Compose entire file in head → one Write call at the end
```

## Correct Pattern
```
Write skeleton → Edit block 1 → checkpoint → Edit block 2 → checkpoint → ...
```
