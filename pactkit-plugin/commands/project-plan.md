# Command: Plan (v1.3.0 Integrated Trace)
- **Usage**: `/project-plan "$ARGUMENTS"`
- **Agent**: System Architect

## 🧠 Phase 0: The Thinking Process
> **Execution Style**: Work through each phase incrementally — output progress as you go. Do NOT try to plan the entire Spec in your head before producing output. Start each phase, show your findings, then move to the next.
> **Tool Integration Note**: If the request involves adapting PactKit to a new AI coding tool (new `format` value like `cursor`, `trae`, etc.), **always start** by consulting `docs/guides/tool-integration-checklist.md`. Complete Dimension 0 (capability matrix) before writing any code.

1.  **Analyze Intent**: New feature (Expansion) or Bugfix/Refactor (Modification)?
2.  **Strategy**:
    - If **New Feature**: Focus on `system_design.mmd` (Architecture).
    - If **Modification**: Focus on pactkit-trace skill (Logic Flow).
3.  **Greenfield Detection**: Check if the request is a greenfield product ideation:
    - **Signals**: Keywords like "from scratch", "new app", "startup", "MVP", "product idea", "创业", "从零开始"; multi-story scope ("multiple features", "full system", "complete app"); empty sprint board; no existing source code files.
    - **If greenfield signals are detected**: Suggest to the user: "This looks like a greenfield product design. Consider using `/project-design` instead, which generates a full PRD and decomposes into multiple stories."
    - Ask the user to confirm the redirect. Do NOT auto-redirect.
    - **If user declines**: Proceed with `/project-plan` normally.
    - **If existing project** (stories on board, source files present): Skip this check — greenfield detection does not apply to established projects.

## 🛡️ Phase 0.5: Init Guard (Auto-detect)
1.  Run `pactkit guard` to check init markers (pactkit.yaml via `{PACTKIT_YAML}`, `docs/product/sprint_board.md`, `docs/architecture/graphs/`).
2.  If exit code 1: project is not initialized — print the missing markers and **STOP**. Suggest running `/project-init`.
3.  If all exist: check config completeness (ci, issue_tracker sections). If stale, run `pactkit update` and report what was added.
4.  If PASS: proceed to Phase 1.

## 🧠 Phase 0.7: Clarify Gate (Auto-detect Ambiguity)
> **PURPOSE**: Surface and resolve requirement ambiguity before the Spec is written. Better to clarify now than rewrite a Spec.
1.  **Detect Ambiguity**: Analyze the user's input (`$ARGUMENTS`) against these signals:
    - [High] No quantitative metrics ("高并发" without QPS, "fast" without benchmark)
    - [High] No boundary conditions ("user management" without specifying which operations)
    - [Medium] No technical constraints (no auth method, no framework specified)
    - [Low] Single sentence input (< 15 words) — likely under-specified but not blocking
    - [Medium] Vague quantifiers ("some", "many", "a few", "大量", "一些", "简单")
    - [Medium] No target user specified
2.  **Trigger Logic**:
    - 2 High + ≥ 1 Medium signals → **Auto-trigger** Clarify
    - ≥ 2 High signals (no Medium) → **Suggest** Clarify (ask user: "Input may be underspecified. Clarify? yes/skip")
    - 1 High + ≥ 2 Medium signals → **Suggest** Clarify
    - Otherwise → **Silent skip**
3.  **Greenfield Force-Trigger**: If Phase 0 detected a Greenfield project and the user chose to continue with `/project-plan` (not `/project-design`), **always trigger** Clarify regardless of score.
4.  **If triggered**: Generate 3–6 structured questions covering:
    - **Scope**: "What specific operations are included? Please list them."
    - **Users**: "Who is the target user? Are there multiple roles?"
    - **Constraints**: "Any technical constraints? (required framework, compatibility requirements)"
    - **Scale**: "Expected data volume / concurrency / user count?"
    - **Edge Cases**: "What should happen when [failure scenario]?"
    - **Non-Goals**: "What is explicitly NOT in scope?"
    - Ask questions in the user's language (Language Matching rule).
5.  **User Response**:
    - User answers all/some → merge into `enriched_input`; proceed to Phase 1 with `enriched_input`
    - User inputs "skip" or declines → proceed with original input (Clarify MUST NOT block Plan)
6.  **Output**: The enriched_input (original + answers) is used as context for Phase 1 onwards.

## 🎬 Phase 1: Archaeology (The "Know Before You Change" Step)
> **Subagent Scope Rule**: When delegating research to an Explore subagent, always provide a **bounded** prompt: target function/class, directory scope, file limit, and expected output. Never delegate open-ended "trace the whole codebase" tasks.

1.  **Visual Scan**: Run `visualize --focus <module> --depth 2` to see the targeted dependency graph. Only expand to `--mode class` or `--mode call` if the focused scan is insufficient.
    - **MUST NOT `Read` a full `.mmd` graph file** — use `pactkit query` or `grep` (see Graph Query Protocol).
    - **Codegraph auto-setup**: If `which codegraph` succeeds AND `.codegraph/` does not exist, run `codegraph init -i` and set `visualize.graph_provider: codegraph` in pactkit.yaml. Skip if `.codegraph/` exists.
2.  **Logic Trace (CRITICAL)** — use pactkit-trace skill:
    - If modifying existing logic, trace the current implementation.
    - *Goal*: Identify the exact function/class responsible for the logic.
    - **Delegation Template**: When using an Explore subagent for trace, formulate the prompt with:
      - **Target**: specific function or class name to trace
      - **Scope**: specific directory (e.g., `src/pactkit/generators/`)
      - **Limit**: read at most 8-10 files
      - **Output**: what to return (entry file, call chain, key data transformations)
      - Example: `Agent(subagent_type="Explore", prompt="Find the deploy() entry point in src/pactkit/generators/deployer.py. Trace the call chain to file writes. Read at most 8 files. Return: entry function, call chain list, key data transformations.")`
3.  **Topology-Aware Trace (Conditional)** — if `detect_topology(root)` includes `api_call` or `agent`:
    - For **api_call**: Run `api_convention_summary(root)` and include path prefixes, fetch function names, and total call count in the Archaeologist Report. This prevents API path convention bugs in downstream implementation.
    - For **agent**: Note orchestration edges from AgentParser (LangGraph/YAML/MCP) in the report so downstream changes respect agent flow.
4.  **Lateral Scan (MUST for Modification)** — after tracing the target, scan horizontally for existing implementations of the same operation pattern:
    - Identify the core operation(s) the requirement involves (e.g., "write to OWL", "send notification", "create DB record").
    - Use a tiered strategy to count existing implementations in the project:
      - **Prefer LSP** (if available): `incomingCalls` or `findReferences` on the core operation's function/method — gives type-aware, zero-false-positive results.
      - **Fallback visualize**: `visualize --mode call --reverse --entry <operation>` — reads fan-in from the project's call graph.
      - **Fallback grep**: `grep -rn "<operation>" src/` — text-level search when neither LSP nor visualize is available.
    - **Output checkpoint**:
      ```
      Lateral Scan:
      - Operation: {name}
      - Existing implementations: {N} ({file1}:{func1}, {file2}:{func2}, ...)
      - Assessment: {Reuse existing | Extract shared abstraction | New is justified}
      ```
    - **Threshold**: If the same operation has **≥ 3 independent implementations**, the Spec's Technical Design MUST include a shared abstraction evaluation before adding the Nth implementation.
    - **Skip condition**: Pure greenfield features with no existing codebase analog — log "Lateral Scan: no existing pattern found" and proceed.
5.  **Solution Design Protocol (Conditional)** — if the requirement involves frameworks already used by the project:
    - Execute the **Solution Design Protocol** from `{SKILLS_ROOT}/_rules/06-solution-design.md` to evaluate capability delta (framework native + project existing vs. needs implementation).
    - Include the Capability Assessment output in Phase 2 Spec writing.

## 🎬 Phase 2: Design & Impact
1.  **Diff**: Compare User Request vs Current Reality (from Phase 1).
2.  **Duplication Audit**: Run the Duplication Audit from system-architect protocol — if this is the Nth same-kind implementation, grep existing implementations and assess shared abstraction needs before writing Spec.
3.  **Engineering Concerns Assessment** — scan the requirement for NFR keywords:
    - Reference the Engineering Concerns trigger index (`{SKILLS_ROOT}/_rules/07-engineering-concerns.md`) keyword table.
    - For each matched concern, the Spec's Technical Design MUST include a decision (e.g., concurrency model, timeout strategy, caching policy).
    - Unmatched concerns → do not add (avoid noise).
    - **Output checkpoint**: `"Engineering concerns identified: {list}. Decisions will be included in Technical Design."`
4.  **Update HLD**: Modify `docs/architecture/graphs/system_design.mmd`.
    - *Rule*: Keep the `code_graph.mmd` as is (it updates automatically).

## 🎬 Phase 3.1: Story ID Generation
1.  Run `pactkit next-id` to get the next Story ID (reads developer prefix from pactkit.yaml, scans `docs/specs/`).
2.  **Output checkpoint**: Print "Story ID determined: {ID}. Writing Spec now."

## 🎬 Phase 3.2a: Scaffold + Metadata Table & Requirements
1.  **Scaffold**: Run `{SCAFFOLD_CMD} create_spec "{ID}" "{title}"` to generate `docs/specs/{ID}.md` from SPEC_TEMPLATE. This creates all sections, tables, and Given/When/Then skeleton — format is guaranteed by Code.
2.  **Read**: Read `docs/specs/{ID}.md` to see the scaffolded template.
3.  **Edit placeholders** (use Edit tool, NOT Write):
    - Edit `Release | TBD` → `Release | {version}` (from `pyproject.toml`/`package.json`, NOT `{PACTKIT_YAML}`)
    - Edit `(Description of the problem or feature)` → actual Background content from your Trace findings
    - Edit `## Target Call Chain` placeholder → actual call chain from Phase 1
    - Edit `### R1: (Requirement Name) (MUST)` → actual requirements using RFC 2119 keywords (MUST/SHOULD/MAY). Add more R{N} sections as needed.
4.  **Journey Segment (Conditional)**: If `docs/e2e/journey.md` exists in the project:
    - Read `docs/e2e/journey.md` to identify defined journeys and their steps.
    - Assess whether this Story's scope touches any journey step (e.g., modifies a UI flow, changes an API endpoint used in a journey).
    - If yes: add a `## Journey Segment` section to the Spec with the format:
      ```
      ## Journey Segment

      - Journey: {Journey Name}
      - Steps: {step numbers, e.g., "2-3" or "4"}
      - Impact: {brief description of how this story affects the journey}
      ```
    - If the Story does not affect any journey: do NOT add this section (Act Phase 4 Journey Sync will auto-skip).
5.  **Output checkpoint**: Print "Spec skeleton filled. Adding acceptance criteria."

## 🎬 Phase 3.2b: Acceptance Criteria & Implementation Steps
1.  **Edit AC** (use Edit tool): Replace `### AC1: (Scenario Name) (R1)` and its Given/When/Then placeholders with actual scenarios. The template already provides the `- **Given**` / `- **When**` / `- **Then**` structure — fill in the content. Add more AC{N} sections as needed.
    - Each Scenario SHOULD map to a verifiable test case in `docs/test_cases/`.
2.  **Edit Implementation Steps** (optional): If Phase 1 Trace identifies 2+ files to modify, replace the placeholder rows in `## Implementation Steps` with actual steps. The table skeleton (headers + separator) is already in the template.
3.  **Output checkpoint**: Print "Acceptance criteria written. Running security scope."

## 🎬 Phase 3.2c: Security Scope
1.  **MUST**: Run `pactkit sec-scope <changed-files>` to auto-detect SEC-1~SEC-8 applicability.
2.  **Edit** the `## Security Scope` section already in the template: replace the placeholder SEC-1 row with actual SEC-* assessments from the output above. The table skeleton (Check/Applicable/Reason headers) is already in the template.
3.  **Fallback**: If `pactkit sec-scope` is unavailable, manually Edit each SEC-1 through SEC-8 entry. Apply docs/tests-only shortcut if applicable (mark ALL N/A with Reason "docs/tests only").
4.  **Output checkpoint**: Print "Security scope filled. Running lint."

## 🎬 Phase 3.2d: Spec Lint Self-Check
1.  Run `pactkit spec-lint docs/specs/{ID}.md`. If `pactkit` is not on `$PATH`, use `python3 -m pactkit spec-lint docs/specs/{ID}.md` instead.
2.  If any ERROR or WARNING rules fire, self-correct the Spec immediately (you wrote it — you have authority to fix it). Re-run until `pactkit spec-lint` reports 0 errors AND 0 warnings.
3.  This prevents the Spec from being rejected at Act Phase 0.5.
4.  **Output checkpoint**: Print "Spec lint passed (0 errors AND 0 warnings)."

## 🎬 Phase 3.3: Board, Memory & Handover
1.  **Board**: Add Story: `{BOARD_CMD} add_story "{STORY_ID}" "{title}" "{task1}|{task2}|..."` (all three arguments are required).
2.  **Memory MCP (Conditional)**: IF Memory MCP is available, use create_entities to store design context (decisions, target files, rationale) under entity `{STORY_ID}`. Record story dependencies if applicable.
3.  **Session Context Update**: Run `pactkit context` to generate `docs/product/context.md`. Set "Last updated by" to `/project-plan`.
4.  **Handover**: "Trace complete. Spec created. Ready for Act."
